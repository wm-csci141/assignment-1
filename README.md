# Assignment 1

## Objective

This assignment is to help you practice what we have discussed in lectures about
Python variables, data types, operators, expressions, and statements.

## Problem 1 (10 points)
Write a program that calculates 3 plus 4. Print the result.

## Problem 2 (10 points)
Write a program that calculates the area of a circle with radius 3. Print the
result. Use PI =3.14.

## Problem 3 (10 points)
Write a program that convert a integer to string. For example, if the input is
123, the output should be "123".

## Problem 4 (10 points)
Given 2 stings, s1 and s2, print a new string that concatenates s1 and s2. For
example, if s1 is "Hello" and s2 is "World", the output should be "HelloWorld".

## Problem 5 (10 points)
Given two strings s1 and s2, print a new string that concatenates s1 and s2. 
This time, add a space between s1 and s2. For example, if s1 is "Hello" and s2
is "World", the output should be "Hello World".

## Problem 6 (10 points)
Given a positive integer with 2 digits, print the tens digit and the ones digit,
separated by a comma. For example, if the input is 34, the output should be 3,4.
If the input is 99, the output should be 9,9. You may assume that the input has
2 digits.

## Problem 7 (10 points)
Given a positive integer with 3 digits, print the hundreds digit, the tens digit,
and the ones digit, separated by a comma. For example, if the input is 345, the
output should be 3,4,5. If the input is 100, the output should be 1,0,0. You may
assume that the input has 3 digits.

## Problem 8 (10 points)
Given a positive integer with 4 digits, print the thousands digit, the hundreds
digit, the tens digit, and the ones digit, separated by a comma. For example, if
the input is 2345, the output should be 2,3,4,5. If the input is 1000, the output
should be 1,0,0,0. You may assume that the input has 4 digits.

## Problem 9 (10 points)
Given a three digit number, print the sum of the digits. For example, if the
input is 234, the output should be 9, which is 2+3+4. If the input is 100, the
output should be 1, which is 1+0+0. You may assume that the input has 3 digits.

## Problem 10 (10 points)
Given a three digit number, print the reverse of the number. For example, if the
input is 234, the output should be 432. If the input is 100, the output should
be 1. You may assume that the input has 3 digits.
